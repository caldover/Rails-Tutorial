# Ruby on Rails Tutorial

## "hello, world!"

This is the first application for the
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial*](http://www.railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/). Hello, world!

Topics Covered in Chapter 1:
- Installation
- Development Environment Setup
- Version Control
- Deployment

Note:
The tutorial uses BitBucket in order to introduce the basic usage of Git through
private repositories. I have decided to stray from that and use GitHub for my
learning.
